### frameplayer

1. Sample pixel data at a constant framerate from video files.

2. Load the sampled data into an event emitter, and "play" it back
   however you like by listening to frame events.
   
Sampled data can be persisted to a file for later use in, e.g.
resource-constrained environments.

Might be useful for your [Open Pixel
Control](http://openpixelcontrol.org/) projects.
